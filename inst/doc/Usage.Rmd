This package includes mainly one function whose return value is available with another package as follows. 

```{r,eval=FALSE}

library(BayesianFROC);

library(tpfp);


#Suppose that object dataList is a return value of the function convertFromJafroc(), which can be used as follows.

     dataList <- convertFromJafroc(
                                  No.of.Modalities =5,
                                  No.of.readers    =4,
                                  No.of.confidence.levels = 5
                                   )


f <- BayesianFROC::fit_Bayesian_FROC(dataList = dataList, ite  = 111, summary = FALSE,  cha = 1 )
